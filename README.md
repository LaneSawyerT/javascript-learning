Javascript-Learning:
This project is a collection of the things I have learned from The Moden JavaScript Bootcamp course.


Clock Timer:
The clock timer function is used to allowed a user to input a number and it will count down from that number.
It has a green circle that displays around and will lower for each 50 milliseconds until it reaches to zero.
If a user tried to input anything but a number NaN will display.


Coin Game:
The Coin Game is a game that lets the player move around the screen using their keypad to chase a coin. 
When the player hits the coin, the coin will reappear somewhere else on the page. The coin animation and player
were taken from a google search.


Maze Game:
The Maze Game uses MatterJS to help construct/draw the maze. Each refresh will generate a new maze with a target to reach.
Once the user hits the target, the maze breaks down with a message telling the user they've won.

Message:
Message will allow users to input any message they want and will send them an encrypted link to share that message with whom they want. 


Movie Fight:
Movie Fight scopes out the IMDB page and will display a movie that the user inputs and compare it with another movie the user inputs. It displays awards, metascore, IMDB rating, and IMDB number of votes. There is an issue that the returned search results display too far on the right. The 'winning' film will be displayed in green while the losing one will be displayed in yellow.
